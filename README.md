# Repository is not maintained
Since v40, GNOME Shell has [built-in feature that shows application icons in Activities](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/40.0/#activities-overview).
So 10 years after releasing the first version of this extension ([which was made for GNOME Shell 3.0.2](https://github.com/sustmi/gnome-shell-extensions-sustmi/commit/f035f8a781a11727e67e79f91471c18b3d1f310f))
it is not needed anymore. What a ride! :)
